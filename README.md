# DevOps Training

> This Repository helps you to learn about DevOps tooling and automation

This repository is intended for corporate trainings, university courses and all people (mainly developers and system administrators, but also QA, security experts) that are interested into learning DevOps and especially in automating their processes and tasks to improve the iteration speed, the quality of their work output, and the overall transparancy in their company.

The complete project can be done without spending a single dime on cloud infrastructure.

## Why?

It is hard getting started with the technical implementation of devops tools. Sharing Knowledge is an important part in devops and this is why this repository exists. This repository should give you some guidance on how you can start. This is by no means a silver bullet and also never finished. Another important part is continuous imporvement. You could use this repository as entrypoint for an internal hackathon at your company or your university. Feel free to share your results and learnings as a pull request to this repository.

Before you start with automating the product lifecycle and implementation of devops tools, you should have the correct foundation.

Start with the culture and the mindset.

You get a slighty different definition for devops when you look at different websites, but the intersection is always culture or the cultural philosophy. So get the key principles straight, then you will be able to profit from the technical tools as well:

* Colloboration & Communication
* Continuous Improvement
* Automation of the Product Lifecycle
* Customer Centric Action & Short Feedback Loops

Here are some good resources to get started with colloboration, communication and continuous imporvment:
